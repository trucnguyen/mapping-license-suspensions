# mapping-license-suspensions
d3 maps of public data set of CA license suspensions by ZIP code and other variables

The left hand side is a static map showing density of license suspensions by zip code. 
The right hand side plots other variables (race, income, age, etc) by zip code in SF so the viewer can compare the two maps.

This leverages previous geomapping code from a civic hackathon I participated in:
